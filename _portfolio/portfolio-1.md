Risk-Centric Threat Modeling: Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis" introduces the PASTA methodology, a risk-based approach to application threat modeling. The book provides an in-depth look at various threat modeling techniques, focusing on aligning security measures with the potential impact of identified threats, vulnerabilities, and attack patterns.

It begins with an overview of threat modeling, explaining its objectives and benefits, before exploring different modeling approaches and how to integrate them into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The PASTA methodology is covered in detail, with chapters dedicated to its application in threat analysis and risk management. The book also delves into real-world case studies of successful threat modeling and examines lessons learned from data breaches.

This book is a comprehensive guide for software developers, architects, technical risk managers, and security professionals, providing practical steps to integrate threat modeling into security practices and mitigate risks to critical business assets, particularly web applications and sensitive data.
