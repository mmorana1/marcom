With over two decades of experience, I specialized in designing and integrating robust security solutions into complex applications and software ecosystems. My career has spanned leading roles at global financial institutions where I built and managed comprehensive application security frameworks. I've been instrumental in implementing secure development practices and integrating DevSecOps, including managing risks in software products. As an active participant in the OWASP community, I've contributed to key projects such as the CISO Guide, Testing Guide, and Threat Modeling Guide, all aimed at elevating application security standards across the industry.

My Career Focus Has Been Security By Design 
======

Security by Design has been a core principle throughout my career in application security and architecture. Integrating security measures early in the development and architectural process ensures that protection mechanisms are robust, proactive, and seamlessly built into the system rather than treated as an afterthought. As Security Architect and Consultant, I've consistently aligned product and application designs with rigorous security standards and controls. This alignment requires mapping security measures across all architectural layers and visualizing data flows to safeguard sensitive information using encryption, access controls, and other security mechanisms. During my tenure at leading financial institutions, I led efforts to implement and enforce these practices. High-level threat modeling during the design phase has proven invaluable in my experience, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities before implementation. By proactively addressing these design flaws, I've helped teams significantly reduce downstream risks and enhance security posture early in the development lifecycle. I've also developed approved security blueprints that incorporate baseline threat models, serving as a foundation for creating additional models tailored to new features or service components. This methodical approach ensures that security considerations are embedded in any architectural change, prioritizing risk mitigation from the outset.

Applying Security Engineering Principles
======
Beyond cybersecurity, my foundation is built on solid engineering principles, supported by degrees in Computer Systems and Mechanical Engineering. My engineering mindset is reflected in my approach to security architecture and vulnerability management, where precision, analytical thinking, and problem-solving are paramount. I have applied these skills to design and secure emerging technology platforms, including blockchain. My engineering background also includes hands-on experience building secure products for Fotrune 500 companies contributing to complex systems with a focus on reliability and innovation.

Software Security As Scientific Passion
------
My passion for science is deeply ingrained in my work and personal pursuits. I approach security challenges with a research-driven methodology, staying informed about the latest scientific advancements and applying them to develop evidence-based solutions. This scientific curiosity extends beyond cybersecurity, encompassing a love for disciplines such as astrophysics and mechanical engineering. This blend of scientific inquiry and practical application enables me to explore and implement cutting-edge technologies while maintaining a thoughtful approach to risk assessment and mitigation.

Mentorship
------
Mentorship is a vital part of my professional identity. I am dedicated to inspiring and guiding the next generation of engineers and security professionals. I have led training programs on threat modeling, established security champions curriculums, and cultivated a culture of continuous learning within my teams. By sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration, I aim to empower individuals to advance in their careers and contribute meaningfully to the field of cybersecurity. My involvement in mentoring also ties into my leadership roles, where I've built and led global teams, emphasizing growth, engagement, and innovation.

My long-standing commitment to building secure software
------
I wrote my legacy into building secure software a long time ago [in this blog](https://securesoftware.blogspot.com/2012/09/rebooting-software-security.html), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), , with a deep passion for embedding security principles into the very fabric of software development. Reflecting on this, I shared some insights back in 2012 through my blog post, Rebooting Software Security. In it, I explored the need to rethink and reinvigorate our approach to software securityâ€”principles that are as relevant today as they were then.
