With over two decades of experience, I specialized in designing and integrating robust security solutions into complex applications and software ecosystems. My career has spanned leading roles at global financial institutions where I built and managed comprehensive application security frameworks. I've been instrumental in implementing secure development practices and integrating DevSecOps, including managing risks in software products. As an active participant in the OWASP community, I've contributed to key projects such as the CISO Guide, Testing Guide, and Threat Modeling Guide, all aimed at elevating application security standards across the industry.

My Career Focus Has Been Security By Design 
------
Security by Design has been a core principle throughout my career in application security and architecture. I had the opportunity to work at projects where integrating security measures early in the development and architectural process ensured that protection mechanisms were robust, proactive, and seamlessly built into the system rather than treated as an afterthought. As Security Architect and Consultant, I've consistently aligned product and application designs with rigorous security standards and controls. This alignment requires mapping security measures across all architectural layers and visualizing data flows to safeguard sensitive information using encryption, access controls, and other security mechanisms. During my tenure at leading financial institutions, I led efforts to implement and enforce these practices. High-level threat modeling during the design phase has proven invaluable in my experience, helping to identify potential vulnerabilities before implementation. By proactively addressing these design flaws, I've helped teams significantly reduce downstream risks and enhance security posture early in the development lifecycle. 

Applying Security Engineering Principles
------
Beyond cybersecurity, a solid foundation in application security can be built on engineering principles, reflected in the approach to security architecture and vulnerability management, where sound risk management analytical thinking, and problem-solving are paramount. I learned to apply these skills by practice to design and secure emerging technology platforms, including technologies like blockchain. 

Software Security As Passion For Science & Technology
------
My passion for science & technology is deeply ingrained in my work and personal pursuits. I approach security challenges with a research-driven methodology, staying informed about the latest technology advancements and applying them to develop evidence-based solutions. This scientific curiosity extends beyond cybersecurity, encompassing a love for disciplines such as astrophysics and mechanical engineering. This blend of scientific inquiry and practical application enables me to explore and implement cutting-edge technologies while maintaining a thoughtful approach to risk assessment and mitigation.

Leaving a Legacy With Mentorship
------
Mentorship is a vital part of my professional identity. I am dedicated to inspiring and guiding the next generation of engineers and security professionals. I have led training programs on threat modeling, established security champions curriculums, and cultivated a culture of continuous learning within my teams. By sharing knowledge and fostering collaboration, I aim to empower individuals to advance in their careers and contribute meaningfully to the field of cybersecurity. My involvement in mentoring also ties into my leadership roles, where I've built and led global teams, emphasizing growth, engagement, and innovation.

My long-standing commitment to building secure software
------
Reflecting on this, I shared some insights about software security severals years ago [in this blog](https://securesoftware.blogspot.com/2012/09/rebooting-software-security.html) More than 20 years later, I still have a deep passion for embedding security research and risk management principles into the core of software development. Even in today’s digital age, with emerging technologies like AI and blockchain, we as security practitioners—whether consultants, security architects, heads of application security, or CISOs—must rethink and reinvigorate our approach to software security. These foundational principles remain as relevant today as ever.
