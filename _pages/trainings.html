<p> <strong> Upcoming AI Threat Modeling Course </strong></p>
 <p class="lead">
      I am currently authoring <strong>EC‑Council</strong> a Course (Consisting in eight sessions, 4 hours total, web based training ) on <strong>AI‑Augmented Threat Modeling</strong>.
      EC‑Council not only provides globally recognized certifications but also operates as a university offering advanced degree programs.
</p>
<p> <strong> Threat Modeling Courses </strong></p>
<p>
      I am offering both <strong>basic and advanced threat modeling training</strong>, covering not only the use of threat modeling tools
      but also the threat modeling practice itself. This would range from conducting <strong>manual threat modeling</strong> to use of
      <strong>AI‑augmented approaches</strong>. The training is tailored to the client’s training needs and application security curriculums.
      These training(s) can be embedded into the client’s existing security practitioner development programs, including
      engineers, security champions, and security architecture‑focused roles.
