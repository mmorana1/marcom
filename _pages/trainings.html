<p> <strong> Upcoming AI Threat Modeling Course </strong></p>
 <p class="lead">
      I am currently authoring <strong>EC‑Council</strong> a Course (Consisting in eight sessions, 4 hours total, web based training ) on <strong>AI‑Augmented Threat Modeling</strong>.
      EC‑Council not only provides globally recognized certifications but also operates as a university offering advanced degree programs.
</p>
<p> <strong>Other Threat Modeling Courses </strong></p>
<p>
      I am offering both <strong>basic and advanced threat modeling training</strong>, covering not only the use of threat modeling tools
      but also the threat modeling practice itself. This would range from conducting <strong>manual threat modeling</strong> to
      <strong>AI‑augmented approaches</strong> tailored to the client’s training needs.
      The training(s) can be embedded into the client’s existing security practitioner development programs, including
      engineers, security champions, and architecture‑focused roles.
