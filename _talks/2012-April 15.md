This document explores single sign-on (SSO) architectural design patterns and security considerations for financial web applications. It begins by highlighting the business need for SSO to integrate multiple systems. The document then covers various SSO use cases and design options, including the use of encrypted tokens or a security token service. It further addresses key security aspects such as input validation, session management, authentication, authorization, and other controls. Additionally, it provides threat models, including examples of attack trees and misuse cases related to SSO architectures. Finally, the document presents a security risk framework to guide the secure design of SSO solutions.
