This document provides an overview of a presentation by Marco Morana from OWASP on developing an OWASP Application Security Guide for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs). The presentation covers the need for such a guide given the evolving roles and responsibilities of CISOs. It outlines the guide's structure and contents to provide CISOs with strategic guidance on application security processes, metrics, and technology selection. A four step project plan is also presented for creating the guide based on input from the security community and CISO surveys.
