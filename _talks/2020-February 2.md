The “Threat Modeling Insider” newsletter brings a combination of guest articles, white papers, curated articles and tips on threat modeling. The content is hosted by Toreon. The title of this interview is “Threat Modeling can be considered as fun as cooking a good PASTA meal.” Note: PASTA in the context of threat modeling stands for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) but methaphorically speaking can be made as fun as cooking pasta meals.
