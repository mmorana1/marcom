This presentation covers a lecture to PhD student summer school on security and privacy. The session explores the complexities of privacy by examining the balance between consumer needs, business objectives, and emerging data protection trends. It begins by analyzing how businesses use customers' private information to drive value, emphasizing the ethical considerations and trade-offs required to maintain consumer trust. The discussion then shifts to the threats facing consumer data, including cyber risks and misuse, while highlighting best practices for safeguarding sensitive information through robust privacy measures. Finally, the session examines future trends shaping data privacy, such as regulatory changes, advancements in privacy-enhancing technologies, and the growing demand for transparency and accountability in handling personal information.
