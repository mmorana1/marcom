This presentation outlines how to initiate a software security program within an organization using a maturity-based, metrics-driven approach. It suggests evaluating the current maturity level, establishing security standards and processes, and integrating security practices across the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Key metrics to monitor include the percentage of issues identified and resolved at each phase of the lifecycle, the average time to remediate vulnerabilities, and vulnerability density.
