The most recent OWASP Italy Day took place on June 20, 2024, in Cagliari, a full-day event dedicated to application security for developers, security professionals, and students. The conference saw approximately 300 people registered, with 200 attendees present on the day. I delivered a talk titled: Threat Modeling AI & Blockchain Applications. My session focused on security-by-design techniques for emerging technologies, including AI and decentralized apps. I explored risks like data poisoning and smart contract manipulation, and shared how to apply threat modeling to these modern use cases.
