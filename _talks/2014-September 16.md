Collecting security and fraud data often results in a large, unstructured pool of facts. Adding context transforms data into actionable information, and triangulating multiple pieces creates intelligence indicative of active threats. This session explores how to generate actionable intelligence, the impact of emerging standards like TAXII/STIX on threat information sharing, and strategies for combining internal data with external threat intelligence feeds.
