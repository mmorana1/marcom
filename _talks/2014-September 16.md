I participated in a panel discussion focused on the role of incubators, accelerators, and innovation hubs in fostering the growth of early-stage companies. The session explored how these initiatives provide critical support through innovation space, access to equipment, mentorship, and occasionally funding opportunities. Panelists, including key contributors to the cyber business ecosystem, shared insights on empowering the next generation of cybersecurity companies to transform ideas into innovative products and services.
