This presentation explores the most common web application vulnerabilities and their underlying causes. It provides an overview of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, detailing each type, methods attackers use to exploit them, examples of insecure code that facilitate these vulnerabilities, and best practices for secure coding to mitigate them. Key vulnerabilities discussed include cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, malicious file execution, insecure direct object references, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and information leakage through improper error handling. The document highlights the critical role of secure coding standards and robust input validation in preventing these security flaws.
