It discusses each vulnerability including injection attacks, malicious file execution, insecure object references, information leakage, broken authentication, insecure cryptography, insecure communications, failure to restrict access, broken XML, and identity misuse. It also provides countermeasures to address each vulnerability. The document concludes with questions for discussion on how organizations are securing web services.
