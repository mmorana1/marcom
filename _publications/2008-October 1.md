The growing extent of risk exposure from cyber threats is not yet fully understood. An increasing number of attacks specifically target software, as the majority of modern network and system-level exploits leverage vulnerabilities in application-layer software. These dynamics significantly heighten the risks to software-enabled capabilities and amplify the susceptibility of software-intensive systems to asymmetric cyber threats.Organizations that rely on software-intensive systems must establish a foundation for justified confidence in their software. Only by doing so can they trust these systems to perform dependably and securely, even under the pressure of ongoing attacks.
