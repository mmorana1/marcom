The OWASP Application Security Guide for CISOs highlights that a strategic approach to application security is crucial for success. By aligning security with the organization's broader goals, CISOs can effectively manage risks, integrate security across all business processes, and prioritize initiatives that enhance resilience. A comprehensive strategy ensures that security is proactive and embedded in the enterpriseâ€™s overall architecture, enabling long-term protection against evolving threats.
