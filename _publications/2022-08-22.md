Security should be a core pillar of enterprise architecture because it underpins all business operations, ensuring that data, systems, and communications remain protected from threats. Integrating security into architecture aligns security practices with business goals, making it easier to address risks proactively. This holistic approach ensures resilience against evolving cyber threats while maintaining regulatory compliance and safeguarding the organizationâ€™s reputation and assets. Security considerations, when built into the architecture, also streamline operational efficiency and prevent vulnerabilities across the enterprise infrastructure.
